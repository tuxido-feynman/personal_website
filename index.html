                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>Professional software engineer, amature father, and recreational athlete.</p>
                <h3>Career</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm a software engineer specializing in data platforms, natural language processing, and search. I've
                    launched two products at Apple, Siri and Apple Search, as well as lead development of data center automation 
                    and human-in-the-loop platforms at Apple. I've worked at seed stage startups as CTO, field architect, and 
                    machine learning engineer. I currently am principal engineer at Roblox working on trust and safety.

                    <h3>If you write software for a living why is your personal website so lame?</h3> There are a few reasons... 
                    I wanted to write all the html and css (with the exception of 19 lines of silver.css). I don't think personal 
                    websites probably need to be 500 kilobytes in size. This is a lightweight site, and you (and me) can easily understand
                    how it works. This site only has dependencies on browser support for basic css, and html. 
                    This website is designed to be slightly less impermanent than the rest of the web!
